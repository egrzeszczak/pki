I'm interested in how organizations do Key, Certificate, and Secrets Management and therefore wanted to learn more about Cryptography in general, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and enterprise solutions to deal with all of that. I also decided to leave a trace of my learning journey in the form a course, that you can fork to your repostiory and go through yourself. 

I'm learning as I create the course, so don't expect the highest quality. Also I'm doing this in LaTeX. Feel free to do a deep-dive into any section.

**This is subject to change, but the course will probably comprise of:**

Cryptographic Foundations

1. [Symmetric Encryption, Block Ciphers and Stream Ciphers](./course/1.%20Symmetric%20Encryption,%20Block%20Ciphers%20and%20Stream%20Ciphers/document.pdf)
2. Asymmetric Encryption, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), Elliptic Curve (EC)
3. Hash Functions, SHA2, SHA1, MD5
4. Key Exchange, Diffie-Hellman (DH)

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

5. Certificates, X.509 Standard
6. Certificate Authorities (CAs), Intermediate CAs
7. Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)
8. Registration Authorities (RAs)
10. Certificate Revocation Lists
11. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
12. Certificate Transparency
13. Extended Validation (EV) Certificates
14. Chain of Trust
16. Cross-Certification

Certificate and Key Management

18. Security Extensions (.cer, .der, .key, .pfx, etc.)
19. Key Management Practices (Key Generation, Storage, Backup, Destruction)

Hardware Security Modules
