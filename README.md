A work in progress public key cryptography course I've created as a way of studying the subject myself.

I've been interested in how organizations do key, certificate, and secrets management. I also wanted to learn LaTeX in the meantime. 

**This is subject to change, but the course will probably comprise of:**

Cryptographic Fundamentals

1. [Symmetric Encryption, Block Ciphers and Stream Ciphers](./course/1.%20Symmetric%20Encryption,%20Block%20Ciphers%20and%20Stream%20Ciphers/document.pdf)
1. Asymmetric Encryption, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), Elliptic Curve (EC)
1. Hash Functions, SHA2, SHA1, MD5
1. Key Exchange, Diffie-Hellman (DH)
1. Message Authentication Code (MAC), Authenticated Ciphers

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

5. Certificates, X.509 Standard
1. Certificate Authorities (CA) and Registration Authorities (RA)
1. Certificate Signing Requests (CSR)
1. Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL)
1. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
1. Certificate Transparency
1. Extended Validation (EV) Certificates
1. Chain of Trust
1. Cross-Certification
1. Time Stamping Authority (TSA)
1. Security Extensions (.cer, .der, .key, .pfx, etc.)
1. Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
1. Certificate Pinning
1. OCSP Stapling
1. Global Trusted Root Certification Authorities
